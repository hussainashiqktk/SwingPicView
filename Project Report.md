Sure! Here's a final project report for the SwingPicView image viewer:

# Project Report: SwingPicView Image Viewer

## 1. Introduction

The SwingPicView Image Viewer is a Java-based application designed to provide users with a convenient way to view and interact with image files. It offers various features, including viewing image files, zooming in and out, rotating images, sliding between images, and deleting images.

## 2. Project Objectives

The main objectives of the SwingPicView Image Viewer project are:

- Develop a user-friendly and intuitive image viewer application.
- Enable users to view image files with ease.
- Provide zooming functionality to allow users to examine images in more detail.
- Allow rotation of images in all directions (90, 180, 270, and 360 degrees).
- Implement smooth navigation between images using next and back buttons.
- Support image deletion with automatic display of the next available image.

## 3. Functionality

### 3.1 View Image Files

The SwingPicView Image Viewer allows users to open and view image files in a dedicated display area. It supports common image formats such as PNG and JPEG.

### 3.2 Zoom In and Out

Users can zoom in on an image to examine it in more detail or zoom out to see a broader view of the image. This functionality enhances the user's viewing experience.

### 3.3 Rotate Image

The application provides rotation functionality, allowing users to rotate images in all directions, including 90, 180, 270, and 360 degrees. This feature enables users to adjust the orientation of images as needed.

### 3.4 Slide Between Images

Users can navigate between images by sliding to the next or previous image. This functionality provides a seamless experience for viewing a collection of images.

### 3.5 Intelligent Navigation Handling

If the selected image is the last image in the folder, the application prompts the user that it is the last image and disables the next button. Similarly, if the selected image is the first image, the back button is disabled to prevent navigating to non-existent images.

### 3.6 Delete Image

The application allows users to delete the currently displayed image. Upon deletion, the next available image in the folder is automatically displayed in the view area. If the deleted image is the last image, the application displays the second-last image.

## 4. System Architecture

The SwingPicView Image Viewer follows a layered architecture, consisting of the following components:

- User Interface Layer: Handles user interactions, displays images, and provides controls for zooming, rotating, sliding, and deleting images.
- Image Processing Layer: Handles image loading, zooming, rotation, and navigation functionalities.
- File System Interaction Layer: Manages interaction with the file system, including image file selection and deletion.

## 5. Technology Stack

- Programming Language: Java
- User Interface Framework: Java Swing
- Image Processing Libraries: Java Advanced Imaging (JAI)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans
- Version Control: Git

## 6. Implementation Details

The SwingPicView Image Viewer is implemented using Java and Java Swing. The following libraries and techniques are utilized:

- Java Swing components for building the user interface.
- Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) library for image loading, zooming, and rotation.
- Event-driven programming to handle user interactions and update the image display accordingly.
- File system interactions using Java's File and FileFilter classes.

## 7. User Interface Design

The user interface of SwingPicView is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. It includes the following components:

- Image Display Area: A dedicated area to view the selected image.
- Zoom In and Out Buttons: Buttons to zoom in and out of the selected image.
- Rotate Buttons: Buttons to rotate the selected image in all directions.
- Next and Back Buttons: Buttons to navigate between images in the folder.
- Delete Button: Button to delete the currently displayed image.

## 8. Conclusion

The SwingPicView Image Viewer is a comprehensive and user-friendly application for viewing and interacting with image files. Its features, including zooming, rotation, navigation, and deletion, make it a versatile and convenient tool for managing image collections. The application's layered architecture and use of Java technologies make it a robust and reliable solution for image viewing.
